### Implementation
* [The dataset is divided into train sets and validation sets.]
* [The size of the validation set must be 40% of the total dataset (the training data has 1314 samples, and the validation data is 874 samples).]
* [Implements image augmentation.]
* [Using image data generator.]
* [Model training < 30 minutes.]
* [Using Google Colaboratory.]
* [The accuracy is 98%.]
* [Can predict images]


## Steps
1. Install the modules required based on the type of implementation.
2. Download the dataset you want to train and predict your system with. (https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml_pemula_academy/rockpaperscissors.zip)
3. Train your data using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)
